# **Diffusion Visualization Explorer - Web**

## **About The Project**

**Diffusion Visualization Explorer - Web** is a web-based tool designed for the visualization of medical imaging data. It serves as an extension of our prior tool, [DiVE](https://github.com/USC-LoBeS/dive), with enhanced functionality and accessibility.

This interactive, browser-based application retains the core features of DiVE while eliminating the need for complex software installation and setup, making it easier to use for a broader audience.

## **Usage**

We have included example `.trk` files in this repository, which can be used to test the application's functionality.

- These test files are located in the `/data/bundles/` folder.
- Additionally, a `stat_template.csv` file is provided for segmentation of uploaded bundles.

### **To Get Started**

Clone the repository to access the data:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USC-LoBeS/Web-Dive.git
cd Web-Dive
